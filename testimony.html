                        <p>We hired [Asbury Services] to carry out a particularly high profile clean at one of our clients' premises, this was the front and side areas of their Head Office and had been left for some time without any attention to the footpaths and road area.</p>
                        <p>There had been numerous attempts to clean these areas in the past but none gave the outstanding results that Asbury gave, our clients were overjoyed and have since used Asbury at other offices with outstanding results.</p>

                        <p>We used Asbury for recent office works including conversion of unusable space to form a new office area plus refurbishment throughout the rest of the 1100 sq feet suite.</p>
                        <p>During the works we were given regular progress reports and all staff from Asbury worked in the most professional manner. They really have a positive attitude and find solutions to issues helping the project move forwards.</p>

                        <p>Finally I hope the more observant ones amongst you have noticed the good work completed by Asbury Services. [Asbury Services] have been onsite for almost 2 weeks and have tolied hard to deep clean all our areas in order to bring the building back to its former glory. I hope you agree with me that it looks far better.</p>
